            </p>

            <p>
              Whether you're a seasoned player looking to refresh your experience or a newcomer wanting to get the most out of 
              the game from the start, these mods offer something for everyone. Let's dive into our top picks!
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. MorePlayers</h2>
            <div className="relative w-full h-64 md:h-80 mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
              <Image 
                src="/images/screenshots/best-mods/repo-screenshots1.jpg" 
                alt="MorePlayers mod for R.E.P.O." 
                fill
                className="object-cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              The <strong>MorePlayers</strong> mod completely transforms the multiplayer experience by allowing you to play 
              with more friends than the base game permits. While R.E.P.O. is designed for up to 4 players, this mod expands 
              that limit significantly.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Key Features:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Increases player limit from 4 to up to 16 players (configurable)</li>
              <li>Automatically adjusts spawn locations and interact points for larger groups</li>
              <li>Compatible with other mods like LateJoin for maximum flexibility</li>
              <li>Scales difficulty appropriately for larger teams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This mod is perfect for larger groups of friends who want to explore together. The additional players can 
              make the game more chaotic and fun, especially when navigating tight corridors or coordinating during intense 
              moments. While having more players can make some aspects of the game easier, the shared social experience is 
              well worth it.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. LateJoin</h2>
            <div className="relative w-full h-64 md:h-80 mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
              <Image 
                src="/images/screenshots/best-mods/repo-screenshots2.jpg" 
                alt="LateJoin mod for R.E.P.O." 
                fill
                className="object-cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              One of the most frustrating aspects of co-op games is when a friend wants to join after you've already started. 
              The <strong>LateJoin</strong> mod solves this problem elegantly, allowing players to join your R.E.P.O. game 
              even after the lobby has closed.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Key Features:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Allows players to join during the truck intermission phase</li>
              <li>Fully compatible with MorePlayers mod</li>
              <li>Works with most other mods, including server listing mods</li>
              <li>No need to restart the game or create a new lobby</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This mod significantly improves the social experience of R.E.P.O. by eliminating the frustration of waiting 
              for the next game to start when someone wants to join. The developers of this mod are also working on experimental 
              features that might allow joining during the shop phase and potentially even during active gameplay as a spectator.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. REPOLib</h2>
            <div className="relative w-full h-64 md:h-80 mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
              <Image 
                src="/images/screenshots/best-mods/repo-screenshots3.jpeg" 
                alt="REPOLib mod for R.E.P.O." 
                fill
                className="object-cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>REPOLib</strong> isn't a mod that changes gameplay directly, but it's an essential foundation for many other 
              mods. This library provides critical functions that allow modders to easily add content to R.E.P.O., making it a 
              must-have for anyone using multiple mods.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Key Features:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Provides framework for registering network prefabs, valuables, items, and enemies</li>
              <li>Enables custom chat commands like /spawnvaluable and /spawnitem</li>
              <li>Fixes audio mixer groups automatically</li>
              <li>Supports developer mode for testing and experimentation</li>
              <li>Allows making networked events for multiplayer compatibility</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While REPOLib doesn't change gameplay on its own, it's the backbone of the modding community. Many popular mods 
              require REPOLib to function properly, including custom items, enemies, and gameplay enhancements. It also includes 
              helpful developer tools for those interested in creating their own mods.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. MenuLib</h2>
            <div className="relative w-full h-64 md:h-80 mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
              <Image 
                src="/images/screenshots/best-mods/repo-screenshots4.jpeg" 
                alt="MenuLib mod for R.E.P.O." 
                fill
                className="object-cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              Similar to REPOLib, <strong>MenuLib</strong> is a utility library that enables more advanced user interface 
              modifications. This library allows modders to create custom menus, settings panels, and other UI elements 
              that match the game's aesthetic.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Key Features:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>Provides framework for creating customized UI elements</li>
              <li>Enables configuration menus for mods</li>
              <li>Supports consistent styling across mod interfaces</li>
              <li>Allows for more intuitive user interactions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              MenuLib is particularly important for mods that need configuration options or complex interfaces. It ensures 
              that mod UI elements feel like a natural extension of the game rather than awkward additions. As with REPOLib, 
              this isn't a mod you'll notice directly, but it enables many of the other mods on this list to have polished 
              and functional interfaces.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. R.E.P.O. Roles</h2>
            <div className="relative w-full h-64 md:h-80 mb-6 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">

                className="object-cover"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>R.E.P.O. Roles</strong> adds an entirely new dimension to gameplay by introducing specialized player roles 
              with unique abilities and advantages. This RPG-like element transforms the cooperative experience, encouraging 
              more strategic planning and team coordination.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Key Features:</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">

              This mod significantly enhances the strategic depth of R.E.P.O., making each playthrough feel fresh as players 
              experiment with different role combinations. It's especially valuable for regular groups who want more variety 
              in their gameplay experience. The roles are designed to complement each other, encouraging genuine cooperation 
              rather than everyone playing identically.

            </div>
            <p>
              Building on the popular MoreHead mod, <strong>MoreHeadPlus</strong> expands the customization options for your 
              character's appearance. This mod adds numerous new head models, allowing you to create a truly unique look.
            </p>
